# nz_vehicle_theft_analysis

## Project Overview
Vehicle theft is a worldwide issue affecting many motorists. This project analyses motor vehicle theft patterns in New Zealand. The aim is to:
* Identify trends in vehicle theft by day, vehicle type, and region.
* Examine how vehicle age impacts theft likelihood.
* Discover which regions have the highest and lowest theft rates.

### Data Sources

What day of the week are vehicles most often and least often stolen?

``` sql
SELECT 
	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, date_stolen) as day_of_week,
	COUNT(*) as num_of_thefts
FROM stolen_vehicles
GROUP BY DATENAME(WEEKDAY, date_stolen)
ORDER BY num_of_thefts DESC;

What types of vehicles are most often and least often stolen? Does this vary by region?
SELECT 
	vehicle_type,
	region,
	COUNT(*) as num_of_thefts
FROM stolen_vehicles s 
JOIN locations l ON s.location_id=l.location_id
GROUP BY vehicle_type, region
ORDER BY num_of_thefts DESC

What is the average age of the vehicles that are stolen? Does this vary based on the vehicle type?
SELECT 
	vehicle_type,
	COUNT(*) AS num_of_thefts,
	AVG(age) AS avg_age
FROM stolen_vehicles
GROUP BY vehicle_type
ORDER BY num_of_thefts DESC

Which regions have the most and least number of stolen vehicles? What are the characteristics of the regions?
SELECT
	region,
	population,
	density,
	count(vehicle_id) AS num_of_thefts
FROM stolen_vehicles s 
JOIN locations l ON s.location_id=l.location_id
GROUP BY region, population, density
